## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Trigger**: The system starts when the input nozzle is engaged, activating a limit switch.
2. **Sensor Sampling**: For 15s, TDS, turbidity, and refractometer readings are monitored.
3. **Decision**:
   - If all three parameters fall within expected range, DEF is deemed **pure**: Green LED lights up.
   - If any parameter is out of range, DEF is **impure**: Red LED + buzzer activate.
4. **Pump A Activation**: Pump starts 15s after trigger, and continues until TDS reads ~0 for 10s (indicating tank is empty).
5. **Tank C Monitoring**:
   - Starts 20s after trigger.
   - Heating or cooling begins if temp is outside 15-30Â°C range.
   - Pump C operates differently depending on temp range (continuous, 2m/10m, or 5s/10s cycles).

## ðŸ“– Backstory: Caterpillar Tech Challenge 2025

This DEF monitoring project was designed and built by Abdullah as a final-year mechatronics showcase and eventually selected for the **Caterpillar Tech Challenge 2025 Finale**. The system demonstrated innovative field-usable diagnostics using real sensor feedback and low-cost automation, drawing praise from engineers and judges for its robustness and adaptability. The event featured challenges like sudden DEF quality changes and variable temperatures, all of which this prototype handled with real-time analysis and appropriate actuator control.

What started as a side experiment with pumps and sensors turned into a competition-worthy solution that stood out for practical utility and creative engineering.
